# Security Policy

- Report sensitive findings privately first (do not open a public issue).
- Do not include live credentials, tokens, or private IPs in logs or PRs.
- Log files are JSON Lines (JSONL); avoid PII. Redact when in doubt.
- Honeypots must be clearly labeled and isolated from production secrets.
